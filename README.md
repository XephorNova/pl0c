# plz
My attempt at writing a compiler for the PL/0 programming language by Niklaus Wirth. <br>
The original grammar by Wirth seemed a bit *loose*, so the grammar used for the implementation has been modified a bit to my taste. See [GRAMMAR.md](https://github.com/ronakchauhan97/plz/blob/master/GRAMMAR.md) for more details. <br>
